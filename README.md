# Face_Recognition_with_MLP
A face recognition machine learning model developed using the scikit-learn library in Python. The hyperparameters were manually adjusted instead of utilizing search algorithms such as GridSearch.  I chose this approach to see how high of an accuracy I could achieve without depending on automation.
